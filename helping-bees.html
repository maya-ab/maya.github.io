            <br>

            <p>Helping Bees is an app that aims to make it easier for people to find volunteer opportunities. 
                The app is something I started alongside three other friends as part of a club competition project. We still continue to work on it in our free time!

                <h3> My Role </h3>
            
            <br>
                When we first started working on the app, I worked on pitch presentations and creating infographics (such as the venn diagram). 
                Once the competition concluded, my role shifted to focusing more on the development of the app.

                    <br>
                    <li>Work alongside the other developer to map out the app's flow </li>
                    <li>Develop the back-end of the app, including database setup and architecture organization</li>
                    <li>Connected the back-end to the front-end of the app</li>
                </ul>
            

                <br>
