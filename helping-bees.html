            <br>

            <p>Helping Bees is an app that aims to make it easier for people to find volunteer opportunities. 
                The app is something I started alongside three other friends as part of a club competition project. We still continue to work on it in our free time!

                <h3> My Role </h3>
            
            <br>
                When we first started working on the app, I worked on pitch presentations and creating infographics (such as the venn diagram). 
                Once the competition concluded, my role shifted to focusing more on the development of the app.
