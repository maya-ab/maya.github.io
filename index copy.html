  <h1>Hello, I'm Maya! </h1>
  <p>
      Hello! I'm Maya Ayaviri, a Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia, Okanagan.
      I have a diverse skill set in Python, Java, Flutter, React, and Javascript that is demonstrated via the projects I’ve worked on.
      I’ve gained valuable skills from working on each one of my projects, such as the ability to effectively work in a team, problem solve, and think creatively.
      Eager to leverage what I've learned through my projects, university, and my work experience, I am excited about exploring employment
      opportunities where I can contribute to a dynamic team and further my professional development.

        <div class="project-content">
            <p> Helping bees is an app that aims to connect individuals seeking volunteer opportunities
                with organizations in need of volunteers. I worked on the app along-side another developer.
                I focused on developing the back end for the log-in, sign-up, and search pages. This project is still a work in progress.
            <ul>
                <li>As a volunteer, you can search through volunteer posts, like posts to view them later, and select fields which you are interested in volunteering in.</li>
                <li>As an organization, you can add volunteer posts and view your uploaded posts on your profile page.</li>
                <li>This project was built using Flutter, Firebase, and Google Maps.</li>
            </ul>

        <button class="project-button">GDP and CO2 Emissions Global Analysis</button>
        <div class="project-content">
            This project was created as part of a project for my data analytics course.
            We worked in teams but each had separate specific research topics. Here I'm displaying only my section of the research which
            focused on CO2 emissions and GDP. My research questions
                  were:

            <ul>

                  <li>How does the relationship between GDP and CO2 emissions compare for the 15 highest income Countries
            vs the 15 lowest income countries over recent years? What about during financial crises periods?

                 <li> How does the average CO2 emissions per capita of high GDP countries compare to low GDP countries, and the rest of the world? Has this changed over the years?
            </ul>
            All of the analysis was done in python. I  utilized pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matlab libraries to create visualizations from my two datasets.
            Using these visualizations I answered my research questions (Only a portion of my visualizations are displayed here, the rest can be found on github).

        <div class="project-content">
            <p> This video sharing website was made for my capstone course.
            Me and a team of 4 other computer science students have been working together
            in developing it. We utilized AWS, Amplify, react, and javascript to implement this website.
                I mainly worked on the front end of the record video and upload video pages, as well as the backend portion of
                the edit profile page.

            <ul>
            <li>Users can log in and record videos via their browsers </li>
            <li>These videos can then be uploaded, downloaded, or played back</li>
            <li>Users can also simultaneously upload videos they had pre-recorded if they'd like </li>
            <li>Uploaded videos get saved to an S3 bucket and can be watched back on the library page</li>
            <li>Uploaded videos can be sent to other users registered with the website along with a description </li>
